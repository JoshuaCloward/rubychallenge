require 'highline'

robust system for requesting data from a user
no need to make error checking or validation
ease the tedious tasks of doing console input and output





ask("string") { |q| q.default = "none"}

validation

ask("age? ", Integer) { |q| q.in = 0..105"}


conversion for answers

ask("birthday? ", Date)

so you can "ask" for "birthday" and it will return a date variable with the answer

so basically it reads in strings or ints and if its an int then it converts the normal gets string into an int for you and checks it all in one line
